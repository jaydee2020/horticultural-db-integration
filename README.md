<h2>Scientific Plant Name Data Integration and Parsing Tools</h2>

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (scientific_name_integration.ipynb) for integrating scientific plant names from a local database with external taxonomic information from the World Catalog of Vascular Plants (WCVP) and the USDA Plants Database. It also includes a Python module (sci_name_parser.py) for parsing scientific plant names into their taxonomic components.

<h4>Project Overview</h4>

The goal of this project is to provide tools for enriching local plant data with standardized taxonomic information and other relevant details from authoritative external sources. The notebook demonstrates a workflow for achieving this integration, while the sci_name_parser module provides a reusable function for breaking down scientific names.
